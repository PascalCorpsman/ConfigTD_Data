# Config Tower Defense (Config TD) Data Repository

This is the data repository for [Config TD](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/ConfigTD).

This repository holds all additional data like maps, buildings, opponents, textures and what ever else someone can think of, that fills the game with life.

The idea behind is, to seperate code from user data, this way you can more easily contribute to the project.

## What needs to be done to play the game

1. Download the content of the [bin](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/ConfigTD/tree/main/bin) folder from the Config TD repository according to your operating system
2. Merge the content of this repository
3. Read the [manual](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/ConfigTD/tree/main/documentation/Readme.md) as needed
